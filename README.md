# Support for Merlin in Vis

The Merlin project (https://github.com/ocaml/merlin) provides editor-independant, IDE-style features for the OCaml language.

The vis editor (https://github.com/martanne/vis) mixes features from vi (modes, movement-action combinations, etc.) and sam (structural regular expressions). It can be extended via Lua scripts.

This project provides the necessary files and instructions to use the Merlin features from within vis.
